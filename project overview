ðŸ“„ Project Description: Emotion Detection from Facial Expressions
Overview:
This project aims to detect human emotions from facial expressions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It leverages the FER-2013 dataset and performs real-time predictions via webcam using OpenCV and Streamlit.

Dataset Details:

Source: Kaggle FER-2013

Format: CSV file with 48x48 grayscale face images

Labels: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral

Model Architecture:

Input Layer: 48x48 grayscale images

Hidden Layers: Convolution, MaxPooling, Dropout

Output: 7 Softmax activated neurons (for 7 emotions)

Key Tools Used:

Keras/TensorFlow for CNN Model

OpenCV for Face Detection

Streamlit for Web Deployment

Output:
The app displays real-time emotion predictions with bounding boxes around detected faces, updating live from the webcam.

Deployment:
The app runs on local systems using Streamlit. It can be converted into a mobile-compatible Progressive Web App (PWA).
